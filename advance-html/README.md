# **Responsive Birthday Gift Boxes Homepage**

This project is part of my practice for building a **responsive homepage** using **Advanced HTML** and **CSS**. The goal was to create a visually appealing and fully responsive website that displays various birthday gift box options. This homepage adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, from desktop to tablet and mobile devices, demonstrating my ability to apply responsive design principles in a real-world context.

## **Project Overview**

The homepage features a series of **birthday gift boxes** that users can explore. The project focuses on responsive layout design, with an emphasis on creating a fluid, interactive interface that adapts to different device screen widths. The design includes **hover effects**, **modern styling**, and **flexible content** that adjusts appropriately across all devices.

### **Features**
- **Responsive Layout**: The homepage adjusts smoothly for various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
