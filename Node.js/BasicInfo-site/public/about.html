    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <P><b>Hi, I'm a passionate learner on a mission to become a skilled web developer. My journey began with The Odin Project, a community-driven platform that has taught me not just how to code, but how to build with purpose.
    </b></P>
    <P><i>hrough consistent practice, curiosity, and creativity, I’ve started turning ideas into web pages and bringing concepts to life with code. This portfolio is more than just a showcase—it's a timeline of growth, struggles, breakthroughs, and small wins that keep me moving forward.</i></P>
    <p>When I'm not coding, I love exploring ideas, creating, and finding inspiration in everyday life. I believe learning never ends, and this is just the beginning of an exciting path ahead.
