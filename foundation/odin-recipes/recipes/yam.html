            <strong class="block">yam </strong> is a starchy vegetable that grows
            underground. Yams are similar to potatoes
            â€” they can be baked, boiled, mashed, grated,
            or cut into chunks. In North America, a yam is
            the same thing as a sweet potato, although in 
            most parts of the world these 
            words refer to two completely different 
            vegetables.</p>

       <h3 class="head">How To Cook Yam</h3>
       <ol>
        <li>Rinse yam clean thoroughly 
            and place in a large saucepan</li>
        <li>Add enough water to cover the yam 
            and add salt</li>
        <li>Place on medium heat and 
            cook till yam is soft. Yam is cooked if 
            a fork goes through it easily.</li>
        <li>Drain the yam (do this to avoid soggy yam) 
            and serve immediately.</li>
       </ol>
