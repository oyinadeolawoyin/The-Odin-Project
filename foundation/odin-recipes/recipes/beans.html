        <h2>Cooked Beans</h2>
        <p>
            The beans known as <strong class="block">in Yoruba, or as cowpeas (Vigna unguiculata)</strong>, 
            are a favourite food among Nigerians, who eat them in a variety of dishes
             including soups and stews or as a standalone side dish. This is great
              news for Nigerians' nutritional health.</p>
        <h3 class="head">ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>300 grams Nigerian honey beans</li>
            <li>1 onion</li>
            <li>75 mls Palm oil</li>
            <li>1 and half teaspoon Nigerian grounded pepper or 1 chopped chilli</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon Salt</li>
            <li>1 Knorr stock cube</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="head">Steps</h4>
        <p>There is little preparation needed when cooking 
            Nigerian beans porridge other than chopping the onion.
            However, Nigerian beans requires a lot of water
            to cook so you might want to make sure that is 
            readily available. Here is my Nigerian home beans
             porridge recipe below.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Place saucepan on hob and add 400mls of water and bring to boil.</li>
                <li>While the water is coming to boil, wash 300grams of Nigerian 
                    honey beans under cold water and toss into the hot water.</li>
                <li>Add half of the chopped onion and cover the saucepan.
                    More often than not, the water will boil over so you
                    may want to cover the pan with half the lid or 
                    leave it uncovered completely so the steam can escape.</li>
                <li>Cook for 40mins. Keep checking the beans 
                    and add more water when needed. It takes 
                    about 2litres of water to cook the 300g 
                    of Nigerian beans but be careful not to 
                    add too much water at a time. It takes 
                    about 40-50mins for the beans 
                    to get properly soft and it should look
                    like the this:</li>
                <li>Add the other half of chopped onion,
                    1 Â½ teaspoon of Nigerian grounded pepper
                    or 1 chopped chilli pepper, 75mls of 
                    palm oil, 1 Knorr stock cube and 2 
                    teaspoons of salt.</li>
                <li>Add 100mls of water, stir together gently 
                    <em>(If you already added too much water, 
                    just stir without adding extra water)</em>
                     and simmer for 15min on low heat.</li>
                <li>Serve with bread or fried plantain!</li>
            </ol>
