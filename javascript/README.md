# JavaScript Full Stack Projects

This repository contains projects developed as part of the JavaScript section of the [Full Stack Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/) from The Odin Project. These projects aim to build a solid understanding of JavaScript, focusing on DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming, and more advanced coding concepts.

## Projects Included

1. **Library**: A digital library application that allows users to add, remove, and manage books in a collection. This project emphasizes object-oriented programming and local storage for data persistence.

2. **Tic-Tac-Toe**: A classic two-player game that implements game logic and dynamic user interface updates. This project showcases game mechanics, event handling, and responsive design.


4. **To-Do List**: A task management application where users can add, edit, and delete tasks. This project focuses on CRUD operations, user interaction, and the use of local storage for saving tasks.

5. **Weather App**: A web application that fetches weather data from an API, allowing users to check the weather by location. This project demonstrates API integration, asynchronous programming, and data manipulation.

6. **Notes App**: A simple application for creating, editing, and deleting notes. This project emphasizes user interface design, data manipulation, and local storage for persistence.


## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring content and user interfaces.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
