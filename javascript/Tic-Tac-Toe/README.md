# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built as part of the JavaScript section in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Full Stack course. The project allows users to play the game against another player in a browser-based environment, showcasing core JavaScript skills such as game logic, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

## Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Players take turns to place their marks (X or O) on the grid.
- **Win Detection**: The game checks for winning combinations and declares a winner or a draw.
- **Restart Functionality**: Allows players to restart the game and play again without refreshing the page.

## Technologies

- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring the game layout and styling the interface.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the game logic, handling user input, and updating the game state.
