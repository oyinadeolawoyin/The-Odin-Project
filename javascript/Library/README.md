# Library Project

This is a digital library application created as part of the JavaScript section in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Full Stack course. The project allows users to add, remove, and manage books in a library, demonstrating fundamental JavaScript skills in object manipulation, array handling, and DOM interaction.

## Features

- **Add and Remove Books**: Users can add new books with details like title, author, and read status, and remove books from the library.
- **Toggle Read Status**: Allows users to update a book's read status directly from the interface.
- **Dynamic Interface**: Uses JavaScript to dynamically update the display when books are added or removed, creating an interactive user experience.

## Technologies

- **HTML/CSS**: For structure and styling of the library interface.
- **JavaScript**: For creating, displaying, and managing book objects, as well as handling user interactions.
