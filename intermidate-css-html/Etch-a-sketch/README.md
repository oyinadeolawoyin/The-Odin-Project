# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a browser-based Etch-a-Sketch project created as part of the Intermediate CSS and HTML section in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Full Stack course. The project lets users draw on a customizable grid, demonstrating fundamental JavaScript skills along with DOM manipulation.

## Features

- **Customizable Grid**: Allows users to set the grid size for different drawing experiences.
- **Color Modes**: Options for different drawing modes, such as single color, rainbow colors, and eraser mode.
- **Clear Grid**: A reset button to clear the drawing and start fresh.

## Technologies

- **HTML/CSS**: For basic structure and styling.
- **JavaScript**: For creating grid elements, handling user interactions, and implementing drawing functionality.
