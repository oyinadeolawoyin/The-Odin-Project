# The Odin Project - Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository for [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum! This repository contains my completed projects, exercises, and notes as I progress through the course. My goal is to build a solid foundation in web development by learning full-stack skills, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and more.

## Overview

This repository serves as my journey log through The Odin Project. Each project folder includes the files for specific exercises or projects, as well as notes on concepts learned.

## Projects

Below are some of the projects I am working on as part of the curriculum. This list will expand as I progress through the course:

1. **HTML/CSS Foundations**
   - A series of exercises to build a solid understanding of HTML structure and styling with CSS.
   - Projects: Webpage layouts, responsive design, Flexbox, Grid

2. **JavaScript Basics**
   - Basic JavaScript exercises for understanding syntax, functions, and DOM manipulation.
   - Projects: Calculator app, Rock-Paper-Scissors game

3. **Intermediate JavaScript**
   - Diving deeper into JavaScript, working with arrays, objects, and more complex functions.
   - Projects: Etch-a-Sketch, To-Do List app

4. **Front-End Frameworks and Libraries**
   - Learning to use tools like React for building interactive UIs.
   - Projects: React-based apps to practice state and component-based development

## Technologies and Skills

This repository will reflect my progress with the following skills:

- **HTML/CSS**: Semantic HTML, Flexbox, Grid, responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Basic syntax, functions, DOM manipulation, and ES6+ features
- **Git and GitHub**: Version control, branching, and collaboration
- **React** *(Coming soon)*: Components, props, state, and React Router
- **Node.js and Express** *(Coming soon)*: Backend development

## Getting Started

To explore my projects:
1. **Navigate to a specific project**:
   Each project folder will have a README with setup instructions if needed.

2. **Open in your browser**:
   Most HTML/CSS/JS projects can be opened directly in a web browser to see them in action.
